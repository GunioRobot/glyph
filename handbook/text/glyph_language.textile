By now you probably figured out what a macro looks like: it's an identifier of some kind that wraps a value within square brackets. More specifically:
* The macro identifier can contain _any_ character except for: @\[@, @\]@, @\\@, @\|@ or spaces.
* The delimiters can be either @\[@ and @\]@ or @\[=@ and @=\]@ (\.fmi[differences between delimiters|#esc_quot]).
