Want to start writing immediately? This short chapter shows you how to get started with glyph in no time. To install Glyph, simply run @gem install glyph@, like with any other Ruby gem. Then, create a new directory and initialize a new Glyph project, like so:

textile.code[=text|
mkdir my_glyph_project
cd my_glyph_project
glyph init=]

That's it. The @my_glyph_project@ directory contains your brand new Glyph project. If you open the @document.glyph@ file with  your favorite text editor, you can start writing your book or article right away.
