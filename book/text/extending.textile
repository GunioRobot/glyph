Glyph was created wih extensibility in mind. You can freely extend &[glang] by creating or overriding macros, to do whatever you like. Macro definitions are written in pure Ruby code and placed in @.rb@ files within the @/lib/macros@ folder of your project.

section[header[Anatomy of a Macro]

This is the source code of a fairly simple macro used to format a note :

<notextile>
code[=
macro :note do
  %{<div class="#{@name}"><span class="note-title">#{@name.to_s.capitalize}</span>#{@value}

    </div>}
end
=]
</notextile>
