Glyph is a _Rapid Document Authoring Framework_.

With Glyph, you can manage your documents tidily in _projects_ and generate deliverables in different formats such as HTML or PDF (through <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a>).

<div class="section">
<h2 id="h_1">Main Features</h2>
Glyph comes with its very own macro system to perform a wide variety of advanced tasks:
* Generate block-level HTML tags not commonly managed by lightweight markups, like @head@, @body@, @div@ and @table@.
* Create and validate internal and external links.
* Include and validate images and figures.
* Automatically determine header levels based on the document structure.
* Automatically generate a Table of Contents based on the document structure.
* Store common snippets of text in a single YAML file and use them anywhere in your document, as many times as you need.
* Store configuration settings in a YAML file and use them anywhere in your document, as many times as you need.
* Evaluate Ruby code within your document.
* Include content only if certain conditions are satisfied.
* Define macros, snippets and configuration settings directly within your document.
* Highlight source code.
* Call macros from other macros (including snippets), avoiding mutual calls.
* Include text files within other text files.
* Include the value of any configuration setting (like author, title) in the document.
* Filter input explicitly or implicitly (based on file extensions).
* Manage draft comments and todo items.
* Provide a simple, less-verbose syntax to write XML code.

<h2 id="h_3">Essential Glyph commands</h2>
Glyph is 100% command line. Its interface resambles <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git's</a> for its simplicity and power (thanks to the <a href="http://github.com/davetron5000/gli">gli</a> gem). Here are some example commands:

* @glyph init@ -- to initialize a new Glyph project in the current (empty) directory.
* @glyph add introduction.textile@ -- to create a new file called _introduction.textile_.
* @glyph compile@ -- to compile the current document into a single HTML file.
* @glyph compile --auto@ -- to keep recompiling the current document every time a file is changed.
* @glyph compile -f pdf@ -- to compile the current document into HTML and then transform it into PDF using <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a>.
* @glyph compile readme.glyph@ -- to compile a _readme.glyph_ located in the current directory into a single HTML file.
* @glyph outline -l 2@ -- Display the document outline, up to second-level headers.

section[
  @title[Something about Glyph]
  txt[

  section[
    @title[What about PDFs?]
