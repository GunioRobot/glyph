Glyph uses a simple macro language to perform advanced tasks like creating and validating links, generating Table of Contents and Indexes, and defining the document structure.

Every Glyph project contains a @document.glyph@ file that is typically used to define the document structure, like the following:

textile.code[=text|
document[
  head[
    style[default.css]
  ]
  body[
    titlepage[
      title[]
      author[]
      pubdate[]
    ]
    toc[]
    preface[
      header[Preface]
      @[preface.textile]
    ]  
    chapter[
      header[Chapter #1]
      @[chapter1.textile]
    ]
    chapter[
      header[Chapter #2]
      @[chapter2.textile]
    ]
  ]
]=]

Even without knowing anything about &[glang], you can easily figure out nearly everything: there's a @document@ with a @head@ and a @body@, the @body@ contains a title page, a Table of Contents, a Preface and some chapters.

By now you probably figured out what a macro looks like: it's an identifier of some kind that wraps a value within square brackets. More specifically:
* The macro identifier can contain _any_ character except for: @\[@, @\]@, @\\@, @\|@ or spaces.
* The delimiters can be either @\[@ and @\]@ or @\[=@ and @=\]@ (\.fmi[differences between delimiters|#esc_quot]).
